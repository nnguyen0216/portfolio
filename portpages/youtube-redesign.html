Although there were several physical and digital products we had in mind for a redesign, we ultimately chose YouTube. It is constantly being revamped, rolling out new features each update. This set high expectations for the user interface. <br><br><b><big>So why the mobile version instead?</big> </b>The mobile version contains a greater amount of design constraints due to the limited physical space that exists on a smartphone or tablet. These constraints often lead to compromises within the user's experience and the creation of discrepancies between the website and app versions.<br><br></p>
    
                 <p><b><big>The Data Collection Process: </big></b>Prior to stepping into user research, our team conducted a breakdown of the app in order to seek out pain points. We found several non-intuitive features that existed around the video-viewing experience.<br></p>

                     ytimg {
                         float: right;
                     }
                 </style>
                 <p><div class="ytimg"><img src="/img/ytq.png" class="ux-info" style="width: 40%; float: right;"></div><br><b>User testing + research:</b> We interviewed a total of 17 people. Most of the interviews were conducted at UCSD due to the high volume of people. Considering most of our users were students and fell into the age demographic of 18-24 years old, all of them had knowledge of what YouTube is. However, their experience with the app varied, allowing us to highlight nonintuitive features within the user interface.<br><br><b>Results: </b>Reviewing the collected screen recordings and notes taken from interviews, we sorted them into the different types of slips and mistakes. In total, there were 23 mistakes and 47 slips made by users. The majority of mistakes (15/23) were <b>knowledge-based mistakes</b> due to users not knowing where features, such as the suggested videos and recommended videos, were located. Mistakes were also created due to misleading icons, causing users to question their purpose. Out of the 47 slips recorded, 26 of them were <b>description-similar slips</b> (where users had difficulty distinguishing between "suggested" and "recommended" videos) and 14 of them were <b>action-based slips</b> (where users performed the correct actions to get to their goal, but were interacting with the incorrect object). <br><center><img src="/img/ytbc.png" class="ux-info" style="width:70%;margin-top:1em;"></center><br><center><i><small>This graph of the errors accumulated allowed us to see what was imperative to focus on.</small></i></center><br><b>Description-similar slips:</b> The most common error made between users occurred during step #4 of user instructions. Almost every interviewee (15/17) ran into confusion while attempting to access the suggested videos feature within fullscreen mode. Suggested videos are videos manually linked by the uploader for the viewers to check out. Recommended videos are videos that YouTube algorithms display to you.<b> 90%</b> of users swiped up to access the recommended videos at the bottom of the screen, believing it was the suggested videos. Why did this happen?<br><br></b></p>
